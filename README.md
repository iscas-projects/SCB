Dataset artefact

Every folder under the root folder contains a `.jar` file that contains a smt folder that contains `.smt2` SMT-LIB scripts, and a `simple_statistics.json` file that contains statistics.

The statistics are collected with Python scripts, and every entry corresponds to a `.smt2` script. Solvers are tested on the scripts and their performances are recorded in the statistics.
